<p><b>Dagger 2</b></p>
<blockquote>Dagger is a fully static, compile-time dependency injection framework for both Java and Android. It is an adaptation of an earlier version created by Square and now maintained by Google.</blockquote>
<p>There are excellent tutorials about dagger. One of them is this video from <a href="https://youtu.be/plK0zyRLIP8">Jake Wharton.</a></p>
<p><b>Dependency injection</b></p>
<p>DI is a technique for one object supplying external dependency for another one, so it does not have to be responsible for setting an action up. Here are some other materials with further explanation by <a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/dependency-injection/index.html">Jakob Jenkov</a></a> </p>
<p><b>Dependency</b></p>
<p>Dagger 2 was added as dependency to your Keddit App in the <code>build.gradle</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>implementation 'com.google.dagger:dagger:2.4'
kapt 'com.google.dagger:dagger-compiler:2.4'
provided 'org.glassfish:javax.annotation:10.0-b28'</code></pre>
