<p><b>Mockito</b></p>
<p>Let’s talk about Unit Test in Keddit App. It’s a critical part of any app development to have a set of unit tests. So today you are going to add some unit tests to this App, those will be focused on the <code>NewsManager</code> class, the one responsible to request, map the Reddit news and key place to be the principal cause of all the mayors problems regarding internet connectivity.</p>
<p><b>NewsAPI Interface</b></p>
<p>Just to make unit test easier, a new interface for the News API was created so now you just can pass a mock of this interface. There is nothing crazy with this new interface so let’s jump to the next part.</p>
<p><b>NewsManager Unit Tests</b></p>
<p>The project was configured through <code>build.gradle</code> to create your unit tests for the <code>NewsManager</code>.</p>
<p><b>Mockito Dependency</b></p>
<p><a href = "http://mockito.org/">Mockito</a> is an incredible lib to make unit tests really awesome and you can use it in Kotlin!</p>
<pre><code>testImplementation “org.mockito:mockito-core:1.+”</code></pre>
<p>If you try to mock a class that needs a generics definition, like trying to mock the Call&lt;T> class from Retrofit, it will not work. But you can still make it work with a useful Extension Function:</p>
<pre><code>inline fun &lt;reified T : Any> mock(): T = Mockito.mock(T::class.java)</code></pre>
<p>And you are ready to go!</p>
<p><b>Task:</b></p>
<p>Finish the mock declaration in the NewsManagerTest.kt</p>
