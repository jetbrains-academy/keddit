<p><b>Reddit API</b></p>
<p>Let’s review a little bit the API that we are going to consume from Reddit. The idea is to request the Reddit’s TOP news to be shown in the App.</p>
<p><b>Request URL</b></p>
<p>The URL that we are going to consume is the following:</p>
<pre><code>www.reddit.com/top.json?limit=10</code></pre>
<p><b>JSON Response</b></p>
<p>As you can see the returned response is in JSON format. A better way to analyse the content is using a Json parser like Json Editor Online (http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/) which is an excellent online tool.</p>
<p>Here there are 3 things that we will care about it:</p>
<ul><li>children: Is the news’ list paginated by 10 items (as we requested in the query string) and each children has details about the news (name, image, author, etc).</li>
<li>after: It allows you to perform pagination with this Reddit API. “after” will bring you the next 10 items by calling: “/top.json?after=t3_4cdt7v”.</li>
<li>before: The same as “after” but to navigate back.</li></ul>

<div class='hint'>You should call <code>onPause()</code> method of the super class here. Then you should pass the constructor of <code>CompositeSubscription</code> here to <code>subscriptions</code>.</div>
<div class='hint'>You should call <code>onPause()</code> method of the super class here. Then, if the <code>subscriptions</code> are not unsubscribed (<code>!subscriptions.isUnsubscribed</code>), you should invoke their <code>unsubscribe()</code> method. After all, invoke the <code>clear</code> method of the <code>subscriptions</code>()
        </div>
<div class='hint'>You should call the <code>observeOn()</code> method and pass the <code>AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()</code> constructor as the parameter to it.</div>
<div class='hint'>You should invoke the method <code>add()</code> of the <code>subscriptions</code> and pass the <code>subscription</code> as the parameter.</div>
