<h3>Reddit API</h3>
<p>Let’s review a little bit the API that we are going to consume from Reddit. The idea is to request the Reddit’s TOP news to be shown in the App.</p>
<h4>Request URL</h4>
<p>The URL that we are going to consume is the following:</p>
<pre><code>www.reddit.com/top.json?limit=10</code></pre>
<h4>JSON Response</h4>
<p>As you can see the returned response is in JSON format. A better way to analyse the content is using a Json parser like Json Editor Online (http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/) which is an excellent online tool.</p>
<p>Here there are 3 things that we will care about it:</p>
<ul><li>children: Is the news’ list paginated by 10 items (as we requested in the query string) and each children has details about the news (name, image, author, etc).</li>
<li>after: It allows you to perform pagination with this Reddit API. “after” will bring you the next 10 items by calling: “/top.json?after=t3_4cdt7v”.</li>
<li>before: The same as “after” but to navigate back.</li></ul>
<p>You can move onto the next task.</p>
