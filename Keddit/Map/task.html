<p><b>Map</b></p>
<p>Another great function is “map” to transform the items from a list. In this case, we cast a ViewType object to a RedditNewsItem but we could also create and return new objects.</p>
<p><b>Lambdas</b></p>
<pre><code>.map { it as RedditNewsItem }</code></pre>
<p>Map is not another think than a function that receives as first parameter a function but Kotlin makes it great, because it allows you to exclude parenthesis and define a code block next to the function name, at the end this code block will be the first parameter required by the function and the code block is the famous Lambda expression, a function that is not declared but passed immediately as an expression</p>
<p>Here we are not going to go to more details about Lists and Lambdas but I think is really a good starting point to see this kind of examples on how to use this great features. Later in this tutorial we are going to take more time to talk about this.</p>
