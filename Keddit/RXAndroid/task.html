<h3>ObserveOn</h3>
<p><code>ObserveOn</code> is another method from the <code>Observable</code> class and it allows you to define where do you want to execute the functions that you provided in the “<code>subscribe(…)</code>” method. In other words, in which thread the functions that you provided in the <code>subscribe</code> method are going to be executed with the <code>onNext</code> and <code>onError</code> code. As you need to execute this code in the Main UI Thread it could be a good idea to make your <code>Observable</code> to <code>observeOn</code> the Main UI Thread.</p>
<p>Here is where the RxAndroid dependency is need to be added to have a new <code>Scheduler</code> called:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-left:10px;">AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()</blockquote>
<p>And you need to update your code to set the <code>observeOn</code> Scheduler:</p>
<pre><code>val subscription = newsManager.getNews()
        .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
        .observeOn(...) //observe your scheduler
        .subscribe ( ...
)</code></pre>
<h4>Task:</h4>
<p>Complete the <code>onObserve()</code> invocation to observe on <code>AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()</code></p>
<p>And with this last change your mock data is creating in another thread and your news are shown on the screen.</p>
<p>But you have to realize that your app can be closed at any time or perform an orientation change operation in the middle of a subscription. This could leads you to a problem if you don’t manage your subscriptions properly, it will be described in the next task</p>
