<p><b>Kotlin Syntax</b></p>
<p>Time to start learning the syntax.
</p><p>Kotlin is defined in many ways and this is one of them that tries to include the most important characteristics in one sentence:</p>
<blockquote style="border-left:2px solid">Kotlin is a Concise, Safe and Statically typed programming language focused on Interoperability with Java.</blockquote><br>
<p>Let’s use this definition to start reviewing our generated code. Here we have both MainActivity files: Java and Kotlin files.</p>
<pre><code>public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        Toolbar toolbar = (Toolbar) findViewById(R.id.toolbar);
        setSupportActionBar(toolbar);

        FloatingActionButton fab = (FloatingActionButton) findViewById(R.id.fab);
        fab.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
                Snackbar.make(view, "Replace with your own action", Snackbar.LENGTH_LONG)
                        .setAction("Action", null).show();
            }
        });
    }
}</code></pre>
Main.Activity.class
<pre><code>class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
        val toolbar = findViewById(R.id.toolbar) as Toolbar
        setSupportActionBar(toolbar)

        val fab = findViewById(R.id.fab) as FloatingActionButton
        fab.setOnClickListener { view -> Snackbar.make(view, "Replace with your own action", Snackbar.LENGTH_LONG).setAction("Action", null).show() }
    }
}</code></pre>
MainActivity.kt
<p><b>Concise</b></p>
Take a look - the Java file has 19 lines of code and the Kotlin file has only 12.

<p>This is because most of the verbosity of Java was eliminated. Concise code takes less time to write and to read so it can improve your productivity.<p>
<p><b>Extend and Implement:</b></p><p>The words “extends” and “implement” were replaced by a colon “:” indifferently. In this case we are extending from AppCompatActivity (which is a Java class)</p>
<p><code>class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity()</code></p>
<p><b>Fun-ctions</b></p>
<p>There is not classic “public void methodName()” structure in Kotlin. Now the functions inside a class are defined with the “fun” keyword and the return type is added to the end. But where is the type returned from our “onCreate” method?</p>
<p><code>override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) </code></p>
<p>In the case of not returning any value in Java “void” is used, in Kotlin the alternative is “Unit” which works in the same way. The compiler will know that the function not returning anything so it can be omitted. In the case of adding it just do it in this way:</p>
<p><code>override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) : Unit </code></p>
<p>Also the parameters are in a different order. First you define the name of the variable and then the type.</p>
<p><b>Bye, Semicolon;</b></p>
<p>In Kotlin you don’t have to put the semicolon at the end of a sentences but still you can do it if you want (don’t do it).</p>
<p><b>Task:</b></p>
<p>Complite the onCreate declaration for it to take a parameter with name savedinstanceState and type "Bundle?"</p>
