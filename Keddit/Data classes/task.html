<p><b>News Item with Data Classes</b></p>
<p>Before creating our News delegate adapter and configure the <code>NewsAdapter</code> to receive a list of news, you need your UI object to represent each news. In Java it is normally to create a class like this:</p>
<pre><code>public class RedditNewsItem {

    private String author;
    private String title;

    public MyNews(String author, String title) {
        this.author = author;
        this.title = title;
    }

    public String getAuthor() {
        return author;
    }

    public void setAuthor(String author) {
        this.author = author;
    }

    public String getTitle() {
        return title;
    }

    public void setTitle(String title) {
        this.title = title;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Again, Kotlin has come to help you with a new class type called “data class” which brings you a lot of benefits and for the same example it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>data class RedditNewsItem(var author: String, var title: String)</code></pre>
<p>With this simple line you are doing the same as the previous Java code, it means that author and title has their own getters and setters and it requires a constructor with this two elements. But you still receive more benefits: if you take this data class, you receive for free:</p>
<ul><li>equals/hashCode pair.
</li>
<li>toString() with all the properties included.</li>
<li>copy() method to make easily a copy of your object.</li>
    <li>and other useful methods, you can see more in the <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/data-classes.html">official page.</a></li></ul>
<p><b>Task:</b></p>
<p>Complete a data class declaration for RedditNewsItem in the Models.kt. It should has following properties to use in your NewsAdapter: author (String), title (String), numComments(int), created (Long), thumbnail (String)), url (String).</p>
</html><br>
<div class='hint'>You should add the <code>data</code> keyword to implement the data class.</div>
<div class='hint'>List the parameters like this: <code>val <i>first_parameter_name</i>: <i>parameter type</i>,
    val <i>second_parameter_name</i>: <i>parameter type</i></code></div>
