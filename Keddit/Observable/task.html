<p><b>News Manager</b></p>
<p>The <code>NewsManager</code> class will be in charge of providing news from Reddit API. It will be responsible for performing the server request and give you a list of news with our already created News UI Model.</p>
<p>The main idea behind this is to make your API call to be executed outside of your Main UI Thread, in another thread.</p>

<p><b>Observable</b></p>
<p>The NewsManager class will provide a method that will return an Observable object which will allows you to run a piece of code (like an API call) in another context (in this case in a new thread).</p>
<pre><code>fun getNews(): Observable&lt;List&lt;RedditNewsItem&gt;&gt; {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>This Observable object will be created from the <code>NewsManager</code>. We will provide the implementation of this object:</p>
<pre><code>fun getNews(): Observable&lt;List&lt;RedditNewsItem>> {
    return Observable.create {
        subscriber ->

        //code to tun in another context
        ...

        //actions on subscriber

        subscriber.onCompleted()
    }
}</code></pre>
<p><b>Task:</b></p>
Complete the <code>getNews()</code> functions in NewsManager.kt to create and return Observable, that will generate news for subscriber (will be added in the next task).
