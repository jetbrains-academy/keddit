<h2>Kotlin plugin</h2>
<p>In Android Studio 3.0 and above the plugin is already built-in there and while creating the new project you just have to make sure to check “Include Kotlin support” and the complete project will just support Kotlin from the beginning without requiring you any extra steps</p>
<p><b>Configure Project with Kotlin </b></p>
<p>To configure a project with kotlin run the “Configure Project with Kotlin” action. <br> A new message will appear allowing you to select which modules you would like to convert and also the Kotlin plugin version that you want to use (just pick the latest one in this case).

    You will notice that the <i>build.gradle</i> file from your module was updated.</p>
<p>You can move onto the next task.</p>
