<p><b>Kotlin plugin</b></p>
<p><b>Android Studio 3.x</b></p>
<p>In Android Studio 3.0 the plugin is already built-in there and while creating the new project you just have to make sure to check “Include Kotlin support” and the complete project will just support Kotlin from the beginning without requiring you any extra steps</p>
<p><b>Android Studio 2.x</b></p>
<p>Ok we have a new Project, let’s install the required Plugin for Kotlin. Go to:<br>

    <blockquote>Android Studio Pref > Plugins > Browse Repositories > search for “Kotlin”</blockquote>
    Install only the Plugin called “Kotlin” and restart Android Studio.
<br>There are other Kotlin plugins but we only need this one as the Kotlin Extensions Plugin was already integrated in the first plugin so we are OK with this one.</p>
<p><b>Configure Project with Kotlin </b></p>
<p>Now we are ready to configure it. Let’s run again the “Configure Project with Kotlin” action. <br> A new message will appear allowing us to select which modules we would like to convert and also the Kotlin plugin version that we want to use (just pick the latest one in this case).

    You will notice that the <i>build.gradle</i> file from your module was updated.</p><br>
