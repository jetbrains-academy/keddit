Android Extensions
------------------

This is the Kotlin alternative for the famous “findViewById()” method (or other third party libraries to bind properties to an element of a view). Android Extensions add some convenient extension properties which allow you to access the elements of a view as it’s a property inside your Activity or Fragment with the proper view’s type already set.

In order to configure your project to enable Android Extensions, you should modify the build.gradle file from your app module, apply the kotlin-android-extensions plugin and re-sync with gradle:


```kotlin
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'kotlin-android'
apply plugin: 'kotlin-android-extensions'
```      
Now the findViewById was replaced with this - NewsFragment layout:


```kotlin
<RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
                           android:layout_width="match_parent"
                           android:layout_height="match_parent" >

    <android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView
            android:id="@+id/news_list"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent" />

< /RelativeLayout>
```      
NewsFragment class:
-------------------

You will be able to access the news\_list RecyclerView from our NewsFragment class. An import to the synthetic properties generated by the plugin needs to be included:


```kotlin
import kotlinx.android.synthetic.main.news_fragment.*
```      
In this way you have access to all the elements in the layout that you choose in this import and use it directly from your code. In order to make sure the layout was already inflated, move your newsList assignment from
```kotlin
onViewCreated()
```      
method to the
```kotlin
onActivityCreated()
```      
to be sure that the view (news\_fragment) was already inflated at the moment of the assignment.

You will be able to access news\_list directly now.


```kotlin
// old code:
newsList = view?.findViewById(R.id.news_list) as RecyclerView?
newsList?.setHasFixedSize(true)
newsList?.layoutManager = LinearLayoutManager(context)
```      
RecyclerView
------------


```kotlin
RecyclerView
```      
is a layout component that allows user to interact with a list of information, providing the fell of its continuity. The toolbar above the
```kotlin
RecyclerView
```      
will remain on top as you scroll the data.

The
```kotlin
recyclerView
```      
interacts with its elements' data using an adapter, which you would create in the following tasks. The
```kotlin
RecyclerView
```      
also uses a
```kotlin
LayoutManager
```      
to describe behaviour of the elements in the UI. It will be also described more in the future.

Task:
-----

Complete
```kotlin
OnActivityCreated()
```      
method in
```kotlin
NewsFragment.kt
```      
: it should set
```kotlin
HasFixedSize
```      
parameter of the newsList to
```kotlin
true
```      
and also set its
```kotlin
layoutManager
```      
to a
```kotlin
LinearLayoutManager
```      
based on
```kotlin
context
```      


Notice that news\_lists and is a non-nullable object so you can use it in your code without the “?” question mark. This could be a problem if you run this code in another part of the Activity lifecycle and the view was not previously inflated, this will throw an exception at runtime.

  
Set the fixed size parameter of the
```kotlin
newsList
```      
to true.Set the layoutManager of the
```kotlin
newsList
```      
to a new LinearLayoutManager passing context as an argument to the constructor.
