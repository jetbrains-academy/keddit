<p><b>Android Extensions</b></p>
<p>This is the Kotlin alternative for the famous “findViewById()” method (or other third party libraries to bind properties to an element of a view). Android Extensions add some convenient extension properties which allow us to access the elements of a view as it’s a property inside our Activity or Fragment with the proper view’s type already set.</p>
<p>Before to start changing our code let’s configure our project to enable Android Extensions. Modify the build.gradle file from our app module, apply the kotlin-android-extensions plugin and re-sync with gradle:</p>
<pre><code>apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'kotlin-android'
apply plugin: 'kotlin-android-extensions'</code></pre>
<p>That’s all! Let’s replace the findViewById with this.

    NewsFragment layout:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
                           android:layout_width="match_parent"
                           android:layout_height="match_parent" &gt;

    &lt;android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView
            android:id="@+id/news_list"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent" />

&lt; /RelativeLayout&gt;</code></pre>
<p>NewsFragment class:</p>
<p>We will be able to access the news_list RecyclerView from our NewsFragment fragment. We are going to include an import to the synthetic properties generated by the plugin:</p>
<pre><code>import kotlinx.android.synthetic.main.news_fragment.*</code></pre>
<p>In this way you have access to all the elements in the layout that you choose in this import and use it directly from your code. In order to make sure the layout was already inflated, we are going to move our newsList assignment from onViewCreated() method to the onActivityCreated() where we are sure that the view (news_fragment) was already inflated.</p>
<p>We are going to be able to access news_list directly now:</p>
<pre><code>// old code:
newsList = view?.findViewById(R.id.news_list) as RecyclerView?
newsList?.setHasFixedSize(true)
newsList?.layoutManager = LinearLayoutManager(context)
// new code:
news_list.setHasFixedSize(true)
news_list.layoutManager = LinearLayoutManager(context)</code></pre>
<p>Notice that we use news_lists and it’s a non-nullable object so we can use it in our code without the “?” question mark. This could be a problem if you run this code in another part of the Activity lifecycle and the view was not previously inflated, this will throw an exception at runtime.</p>
<p>Well our code is getting better! But wait! What if we want to have news_list locally to perform some other actions like setting the adapter?</p>
<p>For sure, you can still use the extended property news_list but for purpose of this tutorial we are going to see Delegated Properties which will help us to do so.</p>
