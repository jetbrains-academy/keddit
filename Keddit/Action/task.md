An action is a logical connection between destinations. Actions are represented in the navigation graph as arrows. Actions usually connect one destination to another, though you can also create global actions that take you to a specific destination from anywhere in your app.


\
**Task:** Here you should add the `action` field to the `news_fragment` inside the `nav_graph.xml`. It should contain `id` and `destination` fields.

You can read more about actions in the [official documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started#connect).
