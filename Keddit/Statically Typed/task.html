<p><b>Statically Typed</b></p>
<p>It means that Kotlin needs to know the Type of everything that you define in the code because the compiler will do a type check during compilation. With the great support that we have in Android Studio (Thanks to JetBrains) the IDE will do a great job helping us to know if we are assigning properly a value to a variable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we donâ€™t have to specify the type when we create a variable (or a constant in this case). Checkout the toolbar constant, the type is inferred from the context and this is another great feature about Kotlin:</p>
<pre><code>val toolbar = findViewById(R.id.toolbar) as Toolbar</code></pre>
<p>Type inference brings great advantages to the language: Reliability (the compiler verifies the correctness of the program), Maintainability (the code is explained by itself), Tool support (what I mentioned before, static typing enables reliable refactoring, code completion and more) and Performance (in most cases there is no need to figure out at runtime which method needs to be called).</p>
