<p><b>Delegated Properties</b></p>
<p>Delegated Properties are an excellent way to reuse common behavior that you may recurrently need for a property. In Kotlin you already have some common delegated properties defined in the language (also you can create your own). Here we are going to use this existing delegated property:</p>
<blockquote><b>Lazy properties:</b> The value gets computed only upon first access.</blockquote>
<p>This topic is really a world so here we are going to see just the lazy property and in other parts we are going to continue introducing another concepts about Delegated Properties.</p>
<p><b>Lazy</b></p>
<p>This is a great delegated property that we are going to use to avoid initializing our newsList as a nullable object. With Lazy we are going to create it as a non-nullable property and will be executed just when you use it and just the first time.</p>
<p>Lazy will be initializing newsList with the value that you execute in the code block:</p>
<pre><code>private val newsList: RecyclerView by lazy {
    view?.findViewById(R.id.news_list) as RecyclerView
    }</code></pre>
<p>Here we can use the news_list synthetic property to avoid using findViewById and as the type can be inferred by the context we can also remove the property type:</p>
<pre><code>private val newsList by lazy {
    news_list
}</code></pre>
<p>The lazy block will be executed when we use it, in this case in the onActivityCreated() method:</p>
<pre><code>override fun onActivityCreated(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onActivityCreated(savedInstanceState)

    newsList.setHasFixedSize(true) // <-- Lazy executed!
    newsList.layoutManager = LinearLayoutManager(context)
}</code></pre>
<p>Also we could move this initialization code inside the onActivityCreated into the lazy block in this way:</p>
<pre><code>private val newsList by lazy {
    news_list.setHasFixedSize(true)
    news_list.layoutManager = LinearLayoutManager(context)
    news_list // this will work as the return type
}</code></pre>
<p>But as we are not calling the newsList in any place, the RecyclerView will raise an Exception as it doesnâ€™t have a layout manager set. So we are going to leave it as we have it previously but we are going to change it in this way later.</p>
