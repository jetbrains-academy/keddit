<p><b>Elvis Operator ?:</b></p>
<p>This is the name used for this operator “?:” and you can use it to give an alternative value in case the object is null. Its like a short way to perform a null check.</p>
<p> In this example “message” could be null, the type is “String?”. In case the object is NOT null we’ll be sending the value of message, otherwise, the value that we provided after the elvis operator:</p>
<pre><code>try {
    // code...
} catch (e: Throwable) {
    Log.e("TAG", e.message ?: "Error message")
}</code></pre>

<p>You can move on to the nest task.</p>
