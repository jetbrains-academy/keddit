<p><b>Elvis Operator ?:</b></p>
<p>This is the name used for this operator “?:” and you can use it to give an alternative value in case the object is null. Its like a short way to perform a null check.</p>
<p> In this example “message” could be null, the type is “String?”. In case the object is NOT null we’ll be sending the value of message, otherwise, the value that we provided after the elvis operator:</p>
<pre><code>try {
    // code...
} catch (e: Throwable) {
    Log.e("TAG", e.message ?: "Error message")
}</code></pre>
<p>Note: if you want to know more about null safety, checkout this link: <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html">Null safety</a>.</blockquote>
<p><b>Task:</b></p>
<p>Insert an elvis operator in the condition check inside <code>changeFragment()</code> method. Note, that a more safe way to implement this would be to exclude Null from the possible argument value of the <code>changeFragment</code>, forcing <code>cleanStack</code> to have a value. This approach will be used in the following tasks, but for now is violated to provide an example of usage.</p>

<div class='hint'>Insert the Elvis operator here to make sure the value of clenStack is allways provided.</div>
