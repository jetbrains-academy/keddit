<p><b>API Model: Kotlin Classes</b></p>
<p>We need to create some classes in order to convert our Json response into Kotlin classes. If we do this in Java we will end up creating big Java files with getters and setters to do this but as we are using Kotlin we can take advantage of this and represent all these classes really easily. Itâ€™s so clean and concise that I can paste here all the code to represent these classes :)</p>
<pre><code>class RedditNewsResponse(val data: RedditDataResponse)

class RedditDataResponse(
        val children: List&lt;RedditChildrenResponse>,
        val after: String?,
        val before: String?
)

class RedditChildrenResponse(val data: RedditNewsDataResponse)

class RedditNewsDataResponse(
        val author: String,
        val title: String,
        val num_comments: Int,
        val created: Long,
        val thumbnail: String,
        val url: String
)</code></pre>
<p>Here we are mapping the previous model that we reviewed with Kotlin classes and with this 4 classes we are ready!</p>
