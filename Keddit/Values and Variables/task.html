<p><b>Values and Variable</b></p>
<p>The way to define a variable is with the “var” keyword. The type will be inferred from the Context and the same for constants which use the “val” keyword:</p>
<pre><code>val price = 100        // Int
price = 30             // don't compile! it's a constant
var total = price * 3  // Int
val name = "Juancho"   // String</code></pre>
<p>You can specify the type explicitly:</p>
<pre><code>val lastname : String = "Keddit" // explicit type definition
var size : Double = 30.0
var time : Float = 15f</code></pre>
<p>Maybe you notice that there are no primitive types, we don’t use “double” but “Double”. This is because everything in Kotlin is an object. For performance, the compiler will transform some of these objects to primitive types internally.</p>
