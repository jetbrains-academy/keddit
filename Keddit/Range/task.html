<p><b>Update NewsAdapter to receive News</b></p>
<p>Time to  modify your NewsAdapter to receive a list of <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">mocked</a> news to be shown with your news and loading delegated adapters:</p>
<p><b>Range</b></p>
<p>Kotlin allows you to create in an easy way a range of numbers (Int, Long and Char types) by using an expression like this: “1..10”, this will return an <code>IntRange</code> (as we are using Ints in this example), <code>IntRange</code> extends from <code>IntProgression</code> and this implements <code>Iterable</code>. Thanks to this is that we can iterate over the range that we have, in this case from 1 to 10 to create our mock data:</p>
<pre><code>for (i in 1..10) {
    ...
}</code></pre>
<p>You can control the steps in the range and make it decremental like “10 downTo 1”. More about this you can <a href ="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/ranges.html">find it here.</a></p>
<p><b>mutableListOf</b></p>
<p>This is a Kotlin function which returns a <code>MutableList</code>, a list that can be modified and in this case is to store locally the mocked news for the adapter:</p>
<pre><code>val news = mutableListOf&lt;T&gt;()</code></pre>
<p><b>Task:</b></p>
<p>Modify <code>onActivityCreated</code> function of NewsFragment.kt: deckare value news as a mutable  list of RedditNewsItem and iterate from 1 to 10 to fill the list up.</p>
</html><br>
<div class='hint'>You should create value news and pass a constructor of the mutable list of <code>RedditNewsItems</code> to it.</div>
<div class='hint'>You should iterate over i from 1 to 10.</div>
