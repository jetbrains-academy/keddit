<h3>Object Expressions</h3>
<p>In Kotlin you have a concept called “Object expressions”, which works in a similar way as anonymous inner classes in Java, and allows you to create an object without explicitly declaring a new subclass for it. In this case we are using it to define our <code>loadingItem</code> without creating a new class. The syntax is really intuitive and as you can see we are extending from ViewType and implementing the required interface.</p>
<h4>Single Expressions</h4>
<p>The <code>getViewType()</code> method has only a single expression function inside the body. In Kotlin you can take advantage of this and convert this method:</p>
<pre><code>override fun getViewType() : Int {
    return AdapterConstants.LOADING
}</code></pre>
<p>To this:</p>
<pre><code>override fun getViewType() = AdapterConstants.LOADING</code></pre>
<p>It’s like assigning the value <code>AdapterConstants.LOADING</code> to a function. This is a short way to do the same and it’s really more concise. Also you don’t have to specify the return value type as it can be inferred by the context. So this is how it looks now:</p>
<pre><code>private val loadingItem = object : ViewType {
    override fun getViewType() = AdapterConstants.LOADING
}</code></pre>
<h4>RecyclerView Adapters</h4>
<p>As it was mentioned before, you need to create an adapter for the <code>RecyclerView</code> to operate with elements. The adapter takes care of creating all of the layouts displayed in the <code>View</code> and connects them to the data. At this step the <code>NewsAdapter</code> was created. It contains realization of several lifecycle methods essential for an <code>RecyclerView.Adapter</code>:
    <ul><li><code>onCreateViewHolder</code> - this method is called whenever new instance of <code>ViewHolder</code> is created.</li>
        <li><code>onBindViewHolder</code> - this method is called when the <code>ViewHolder</code> is bind to a certain position of the <code>RecyclerView</code> layout.</li>
        <li><code>getItemCount</code> returns the total number of items currently included into the <code>RecyclerView</code>.</li>
        <li><code>getItemViewType</code> returns the <code>ViewType</code> of an item at the position indicated by the index in the method parameter.</li>
    </ul>
There are also implementations of initial actions the adapter need to complete on the instance creation and private fields for two delegate adapters - <code>LoadingDelegateAdapter</code> and <code>NewsDelegateAdapter</code>. Both of them implement <code>onCreateViewHolder</code> and <code>onBindViewHolder</code> (which are called by the same named methods from the <code>NewsAdapter</code>). This structure is complicated due to the fact that the <code>RecyclerView</code> whould contain two different types of items - news from Reddit and a loading sign, inserted to the bottom of the list as one of the elements. The adapters are both implementations of an interface called <code>ViewTypeDelegateAdapter</code> describing these methods.</p>
<p>There are also several service entities - <code>ViewType</code> interface describing the <code>getViewType</code> method and <code>AdapterConstants</code> object containing constants for the types representation. <code>TimeExt</code> provides the ways for the app to describe, how long ago was particular news posted. It may seem like a lot of code but it is actually very straight-forward, so it won't be covered here.</p>
<p>One more modification - the Extensions was modified, a <code>loadImg</code> method was added to the <code>ImageView</code> class. It provides an image for a News item, loaded via picasso, and if the url is missing (e.g. in case of mocking) provides one of the default icons.</p>
<h4>Task:</h4>
<p>Complete the <code>getViewType()</code> function override for it to return NEWS adapter constant in <code>Models.kt</code> in <code>commons</code> package. </p>

<div class='hint'>Add the AdapterConstants property NEWS as the return value.</div>
